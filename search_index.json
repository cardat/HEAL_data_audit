First we describe the approach to use a relational data model of linking files within datasets within projects. Files, Datasets and Projects in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML) The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) schema is defined by the ‘Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity’ - KNB (https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#tools/eml). A schematic diagram of the EML modules: The figure below shows EML as a hierarchy. An EML document contains a dataset module that allows the grouping of one or more data entities (e.g. a file) linked together by particular rules to form a Data Package. The project module places the dataset that is being documented into its larger research context, and allows multiple related Data Packages to be linked. Motivation/Justification The backend uses a web2py database app, and R helper functions written by Ivan Hanigan There is a need for a data inventory tool to enable ecological data collections to be managed more efficiently The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) provides an excellent standardised schema for metadata, but the associated software Morpho does not have the flexibility or extensibility that would enable a data manager to use it to manage large and heterogeneous data collections KNB is a subproject of Ecoinformatics.org (http://ecoinformatics.org/) an open source collaboration that aims to produce software, systems, and services primarily for the ecological sciences. We apply these to Human Ecology systems too. XML A minimal EML document is summarised below. This is a schematic view that shows the structure of an EML XML document. Only a few of the possible components are included. In the graphic above the mandatory component of the EML is shown as a firm line, in contrast with those aspects of the EML which are not mandatory (dotted lines). That is: dataset title, creator and contact are the only required elements for a valid EML Data Package. &lt;eml&gt; &lt;dataset&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;creator&gt; &lt;contact&gt; &lt;project&gt; &lt;title&gt; &lt;personnel&gt; &lt;role&gt; &lt;abstract&gt; &lt;funding&gt; &lt;studyAreaDescription&gt; &lt;designDescription&gt; &lt;relatedProject&gt; &lt;associatedParty&gt; &lt;publisher&gt; &lt;pubDate&gt; &lt;keywords&gt; &lt;abstract&gt; &lt;intellectualright&gt; &lt;methods&gt; &lt;coverage&gt; &lt;dataTable&gt; &lt;entityName&gt; &lt;entityDescription&gt; &lt;physical&gt; &lt;attribute&gt; &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; &lt;additionalLinks&gt; The parts of an EML document In EML, the term dataset is applied to a document which may contain general information such as the title, creator, and contacts, abstract and keywords as well as one or more data entities, such as datatables, that provide more specific research details. The information is at the level of a particular data collection or study, however there is also a level above this at the “project” level where research studies can be grouped together. In EML, the term dataset refers to one or more data entities. However, there is no generally accepted practice on what to include in an EML-dataset document. Some people will choose to have a one-to-one correspondence between an EML document and a data entity and a single physical file. Others will document several data entities in one dataset document. Below is a brief description of the way we interpret the components of an EML dataset Datasets Dataset is the top level of the EML. The miminum necessary to produce a valid EML document is &lt;title&gt;, &lt;creator&gt;, &lt;contract&gt;. But one can’t tell very much with just a title and a name. Our aim is to create an EML document that contains enough information about the data and research to make funding agencies happy and give other ecologists something to work with. Datasets may include one or more data entities such as data tables and spatial images along with associated metadata, but inclusion of data entities are not mandatory. The dataset module enables entities which are linked together to be grouped logically. LTERN groups entities into a single dataset using a range of integrity constraints such as the use of a specific sampling structure or monitoring theme employed over a discrete temporal and geographic range. In the context of the work undertaken by the LTERN Data Portal Team, the term dataset is sometimes used interchangeably with the term data package, however it should be recognised that these are not exactly the same. The dataset module is a part of an EML document which forms the basis for a data package. In EML, the dataset tag contains general information about a dataset; at minimum this must comprise a title, one Data Creator and a contact (often the Data Creator and contact will be the same). Additional information such as abstract, temporal coverage, keywords, geographic coverage and methods are used to provide context for the published or archived data packages. For more information about the general EML descriptions see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-resource.html For more detailed information about the EML-dataset module see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-dataset.html Projects The project module is optional, but in many cases highly desirable as this provides an overall description of the larger-scale project or research context with which that dataset is associated. For example it might be an entire Longterm Ecological Research Network (LTER) site, or an individual project at an LTER site. The EML “project” module of the EML enables data packages to be grouped logically together. The project module is primarily used by LTERN to identify the Data Owner and the source of funding. The project module is recursive in that it provides an overall description of the larger-scale project or research context for the specific project with which that data package is associated. Information in the project tag of the EML include detailed descriptions of the aims and objectives of the research, funding sources, personnel and a description of the study area. This module also includes content on the study and sampling design and the methods employed during the research. As an example, a project might comprise an entire Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTERN) plot network or an individual project at an LTERN site. For more information about the EML-dataset module see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-project.html Data Entity As stated earlier, a dataset consists of one or more data entities, and the most common data entity is a dataTable. A data table is something that looks like a matrix with rows for observations and columns for variables In addition to datatables, people using database applications may also produce a view from a database management system or a storedProcedure that results in data output. People using GIS (geographical information system) applications generate both spatialVector, also referred to as boundary or shape files, and spatialRaster. A spatialRaster is a geo-referenced image usually produced by a camera on a satellite or other remote sensing device. The final kind of data entity is otherEntity. An otherEntity is a data entity that cannot be represented by any of the previously defined data entity structures. A non-geo-referenced photograph is an otherEntity, e.g., a photograph of two different types of butterflies. For more information about types of EML-entities see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/#N10115 Attributes An attribute or as it is sometime referred to, variable, in this context refers to the name of the column of a datatable For more information about the EML dataTable type (especially its attributes) see: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#external//emlparser/docs/eml-2.1.1/eml-dataTable.html#attribute "],["datasets-overview.html", "1.1 Datasets Overview", " 1.1 Datasets Overview Provision status categories: Identified, Requested, Provided, Published, TBC "],["abs_data.html", "2 ABS_data", " 2 ABS_data metadata_field title ABS_data personnel_data_owner Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) project_abstract "],["abs_census_2021.html", "2.1 ABS_Census_2021", " 2.1 ABS_Census_2021 metadata_field shortname ABS_Census_2021 title ABS_Census_2021 creator Australian Bureau of Statistics contact_email car.data@sydney.edu.au abstract This is the collection of data related to 2021 Census. additional_metadata NOT YET PUBLISHED alternate_identifier associated_party access_rules Public domain.

Increases in global temperature have result in an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves. Pregnancy is a time of substantial physiological change, and thus maternal and neonatal health outcomes are susceptible to adverse effects of heat. There is a lack of knowledge on thermoregulation in pregnancy, including how effectively pregnant people adapt in different climate contexts and what specific environmental conditions present the largest thermoregulatory challenges. The aim of this study is to examine the association between exposure to heat during pregnancy and maternal and neonatal health outcomes across different Australian climate zones. | | All neonates born in Australia between 1991 and 2023 will be identified from national perinatal records (approximately 8.6 million neonates). Perinatal records contain information on maternal and neonatal health, demographics, and characteristics of labour and delivery. Data on congenital anomalies will also be available for a subset of the cohort born in Western Australia over the same period (approximately 900,000 neonates). Records on perinatal and congenital anomalies will be linked to weather data held by the Bureau of Meteorology using geocodes and the ERA5 database. The effect of heat exposure and heat stress on health outcomes during pregnancy will be determined. Exposure to heatwaves during pregnancy will be based on three day average temperatures, average temperature for the 30 days prior, and historical high temperatures for that area. Heat stress will then be assessed by also taking into account humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation as well as temperature. The association between heatwaves or heat stress during pregnancy and health outcomes will be performed using multilevel mixed models, adjusting for covariates including cigarette smoking during pregnancy, parity, maternal age, and Aboriginality.

Fires are an important source of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols and they are the most important disturbance agent on a global scale. In addition, deforestation and tropical peatland fires and areas that see an increase in the frequency of fires add to the build-up of atmospheric CO2. We have combined satellite information on fire activity and vegetation productivity to estimate gridded monthly burned area and fire emissions, as well as scalars that can be used to calculate higher temporal resolution emissions. Most of the resulting datasets are downloadable from this website for use in large-scale atmospheric and biogeochemical studies. The core datasets are: Burned area from Giglio et al. (2013) Burned area from \"” fires based on active fire detections outside the burned area maps detailed in Randerson et al. (2012) and updates in van der Werf et al. (2017) "],["global_fire_emissions_database_v4.html", "17.1 Global_Fire_Emissions_Database_v4.1", " 17.1 Global_Fire_Emissions_Database_v4.1 metadata_field shortname Global_Fire_Emissions_Database_v4.1 title Global_Fire_Emissions_Database_v4.1 creator Louis Giglio, James Randerson, Guido van de Werf &amp; Neils Andela contact_email car.data@sydney.edu.au abstract This dataset provides global estimates of monthly burned area, monthly emissions and fractional contributions of different fire types, daily or 3-hourly fields to scale the monthly emissions to higher temporal resolutions, and data for monthly biosphere fluxes. The data are at 0.25-degree latitude by 0.25-degree longitude spatial resolution and are available from June 1995 through 2016, depending on the dataset. Emissions data are available for carbon (C), dry matter (DM), carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC), particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), total particulate matter (TPM), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) among others. These data are yearly totals by region, globally, and by fire source for each region. This Version 4, R1 dataset includes data described as GFED4 and GFED4.1s from the data provider. GFED4 data are without small fire inputs and are in HDF format. The GFED4.1s data include small fires and are provided in HDF5 format. The mapped burned area is without small fires, and this is the GFED4 burned area described in Giglio et al. (2013). The emissions fields are based on this dataset but boosted with small fires, GFED4.1s. The emissions fields also contain a layer with the fraction of emissions resulting from this boost. Additional information may be obtained from the Global Fire Data website: http://www.globalfiredata.org/index.html. The dataset is divided into the following main datasets. Data products include: Monthly and Daily Burned Area (GFED4 - without small fires) Global monthly burned area (ha) at 0.25-degree x 0.25-degree for 1997 to 2016 in HDF (.hdf) format (GFED4). Global daily burned area for a subset of the time series from Aug 2000 to 2015 in HDF (.hdf) format (GFED4). 2. Emissions (monthly, daily, 3-hourly) and burned area (GFED4s - with small fires) Annual files with monthly GFED4s burned area (including small fires), emissions, and scalars to distribute the monthly emissions over the days as well as the diurnal cycle as HDF5 (.hdf5) format (GFED4s) for the time period 1997 to 2015. These files contain fire carbon emissions (g C m-2 month-1) and dry matter emissions (kg DM m-2 month-1). In addition, fractional contributions of different fire types (grassland and savanna, woodland, deforestation and degradation, forest, agricultural waste burning, and peat fires) are provided within each file. The CASA-GFED biosphere flux sources include Net Primary Production (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), and fires (biomass burning). Rh has been updated for all years in this distribution due to a correction in only the Rh values. Available for years 2003 onward are daily / 3-hourly emissions which are scalar fields that can be used in combination with monthly emissions files to estimate emissions on a higher temporal resolution. Regional estimates for various trace gases and aerosol emissions are provided, in text format, that contain annual emissions (1997 - 2016) per region for totals of C and individual species from all sources, yearly lumped sources such as higher alkanes, higher alkenes, and toluenes, and from each individual fire source (forest fires, peat fires, agricultural waste burning, etc). These files are for indicative use only; they are not suitable for official reporting due to large uncertainties and the potential for aspects of information from key regions to be missing in the global approach used. There are 41 text files. Related files include emission factors (EF) data for individual species by biome (fire source) in comma-separated (.csv) format. There are 2 csv files. There are a total of 5,952 files with this dataset.

Its primary objective is to support research questions falling within three broad and inter-related areas of income, labour market and family dynamics. The HILDA Survey has the following key features: By the nature of its design, the study can be extended to continue indefinitely, following not only the initial sample members for the remainder of their lives, but also the lives of descendants. Special questionnaire modules are included as part of each wave, focusing on particular topics in detail. Modules are included in the survey on a rotating basis. The Wave 1 panel consisted of 19,914 individuals in 7,682 households. In Wave 11 this was topped up with an additional 5,462 individuals in 2,153 households. Fieldwork for each wave is conducted from July each year. Each wave of HILDA includes at least one major topic of focus, which is repeated every four years. These topics include: household wealth (waves 2, 6, 10, 14,18 and 22); fertility and partnering (waves 5, 8, 11, 15 and 19); retirement from the workforce (waves 3, 7, 11, 15 and 19); health (waves 9, 13, 17 and 21); and education, skills and abilities (waves 12, 16 and 20). In addition, there are a number of shorter sets of questions included on a rotating basis, including: history and status of parents (waves 8, 12, 15 and 19); siblings (waves 8, 12 and 19); intentions and plans (waves 5, 8 and 11); literacy and numeracy (waves 7, 12, 16 and 20); and material deprivation (waves 14,18 and 22). The HILDA Survey does not include diplomatic personnel of overseas governments, overseas residents in Australia, or members of non-Australian defence forces.

Air pollution from landscape fires can negatively affect human health4,5,6, but human exposure to landscape fire-sourced (LFS) air pollution has not been well characterized at the global scale7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. Here, we estimate global daily LFS outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and surface ozone concentrations at 0.25° × 0.25° resolution during the period 2000–2019 with the help of machine learning and chemical transport models. We found that overall population-weighted average LFS PM2.5 and ozone concentrations were 2.5 µg m−3 (6.1% of all-source PM2.5) and 3.2 µg m−3 (3.6% of all-source ozone), respectively, in 2010–2019, with a slight increase for PM2.5, but not for ozone, compared with 2000–2009. Central Africa, Southeast Asia, South America and Siberia experienced the highest LFS PM2.5 and ozone concentrations. The concentrations of LFS PM2.5 and ozone were about four times higher in low-income countries than in high-income countries. During the period 2010–2019, 2.18 billion people were exposed to at least 1 day of substantial LFS air pollution per year, with each person in the world having, on average, 9.9 days of exposure per year. These two metrics increased by 6.8% and 2.1%, respectively, compared with 2000–2009. Overall, we find that the global population is increasingly exposed to LFS air pollution, with socioeconomic disparities. | Sourced from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06398-6 "],["substantial_bushfire_related_air_pollution.html", "27.1 Substantial_bushfire_related_air_pollution", " 27.1 Substantial_bushfire_related_air_pollution metadata_field shortname Substantial_bushfire_related_air_pollution title Substantial_bushfire_related_air_pollution creator R.
